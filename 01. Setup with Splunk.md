Ensure the data was ingested by going to the Search and Reporting app and setting the time picker to a range between 1 August 2017- 31 August 2017. Use the query below:

```powershell
index=botsv2 sourcetype=stream:smtp
```

If you have multiple hits to your query, as seen below, the data ingestion was successful.
