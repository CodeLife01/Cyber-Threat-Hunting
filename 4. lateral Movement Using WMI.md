# Threat Hunting with Splunk Part 3: Lateral Movement using WMI

## Summary:

In this lesson we will continue cyber threat hunting using Splunk and the Boss of the SOC (BOTS) version 2 dataset. In the last exercise we discovered the initial access of the attack, that included a phishing email with an attachment. Based on that finding and further threat intelligence information we will hunt for lateral movement. ¬†

**Updated Threat Intel Report Excerpt**

The threat actor targeting our organization is known to use WMI (Windows Management instrumentation) for lateral movement (ATT&CK Technique T1047). The adversary is known to abuse WMI to achieve execution. They use WMI to interact with local and remote systems and use it as a means to perform many functions, such as gathering information for Discovery and remote Execution of files as part of Lateral Movement.

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a Microsoft framework that provides a standardized interface for managing and querying system components on Windows-based computers. It allows administrators to gather detailed information about hardware and software, automate routine tasks, and manage systems remotely using scripts and applications. WMI can be leveraged for system monitoring, inventory management, and security auditing, but it can also be exploited by attackers for malicious activities, including remote access/lateral movement.

The table below provides the sourcetype, Event Code, and key:value pairs to search for malicious use of WMI for remote access/lateral movement. This table focuses on the destination host.  

| **Sourcetype** | **Event Code** | **Details** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sysmon | 1             (Process Create) | **ParentImage**: Executable file of the parent process (C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe) |
|  |  | **CommandLine**: Command line of the execution command (C:\Windows\system32\wbem\wmiprvse.exe -secured -Embedding) |
|  |  | **ParentCommandLine**: Command line of the parent process (C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe -k DcomLaunch) |
|  |  | **User:** Execute as user (NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE) |
|  |  | Image: Path to the executable file (C:\Windows\System32\wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe) |

Additionally, the table below depicts a sequence of events that can be used to discover WMI being abused for remote access/lateral movement. 

| **Sequence** | **Sourcetype** | **Event** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Windows Event | Event 4624 with Logon Type 3 (Network Logon) |
| 2 | Windows Event | Event 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned) |
| 3 | Sysmon | Event Code 1 (Process Creation) wmiprvse.exe |

**Hypothesis**

Based on threat intelligence we assume that the malicious actor has moved laterally in our organization using WMI.

**Plan of Action**   

Looking for evidence of WMI alone would not be helpful because it is used legitimately across our network.  We want to focus on WMI being used in the context of lateral movement. We will initially  concentrate on Sysmon logs because they provide us a way to view lateral movement between Windows hosts. We will use the information from our threat intel team in the first table to base our initial query. We can then follow up by crafting a query based on the sequence of events in the second table. Lastly, based on our discovery of the compromised system last week, we will narrow our hunt to between August 23-24, 2017. 

**Initial query**

As previously mentioned, we will narrow our hunt to between August 23-24, 2017.

Using the information from the first table shown above we can craft our initial query seen below:

```powershell
index=botsv2 sourcetype="xmlwineventlog:microsoft-windows-sysmon/operational" EventCode=1 ParentImage="C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe" CurrentDirectory="C:\\Windows\\system32\\" CommandLine="C:\\Windows\\system32\\wbem\\wmiprvse.exe -secured -Embedding" ParentCommandLine="C:\\Windows\\system32\\svchost.exe -k DcomLaunch" User="NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE" Image="C:\\Windows\\System32\\wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe"
```

We see there were 11 hits.

A closer look at the results show that all 11 hits were from the same host. The host belongs to Kevin Lagerfield. This is a new discovery.

Now we know that at least one workstation was very likely the destination host for lateral movement attempt. At this time we do not know if the attempt was successful.

We can craft a second query based on the sequence of events outlined in the second table provided by the threat intel team.

```go
index=botsv2
(sourcetype=wineventlog* (EventCode=4624 Logon_Type=3)) OR (sourcetype="xmlwineventlog:microsoft-windows-sysmon/operational" ParentCommandLine!="*\\svchost.exe" EventCode=1)
| eval login=mvindex (Logon_ID,1)
| eval user_id=mvindex(Security_ID,1)
| eval session=lower(coalesce(login,LogonId))
| transaction session startswith=(EventCode=4624) mvlist=ParentImage
| search eventcount>1
| eval Parent_Process=mvindex(ParentImage, 1)
| table _time dest session host user_id Parent_Process Image CommandLine
```

The Splunk query performs a series of steps to the sequence of events of WMI abuse for remote access/lateral movement. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

1. **Search Scope:**
    - It searches within the `botsv2` index.
    - It looks for Windows Event Logs that indicate a logon event (EventCode 4624) with a network logon type (Logon_Type 3).
    - Additionally, it includes Sysmon events for process creation (EventCode 1) but excludes processes where the parent command line contains `svchost.exe`.
2. **Field Extraction:**
    - The query extracts the `Logon_ID` and `Security_ID` from the log events and assigns them to `login` and `user_id`.
    - It creates a `session` field by combining `login` and `LogonId`, converting the result to lowercase.
3. **Transaction Creation:**
    - Events are grouped into transactions based on the `session` field.
    - Each transaction starts with a logon event (EventCode 4624) and includes a list of parent images of processes.
4. **Transaction Filtering:**
    - Only transactions with more than one event are retained, filtering out isolated events.
5. **Field Evaluation and Display:**
    - The second element of the `ParentImage` list is extracted and stored in `Parent_Process`.
    - The final output is a table displaying the time, destination, session, host, user ID, parent process, image, and command line fields for further analysis.

As seen below, we have identified two hosts (venus and wrk-klagerf) that show signs of execution using the account ‚Äúservice3‚Äù.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/15bc5144-a76f-4c10-8849-c99b08c9eb32/653f9363-3bf5-4ed1-9107-245140e1e19c/Untitled.png)

Now we can take the session values and using their original field names (Logon_ID (Sysmon) and LogonId (Windows Events)) we can breakout the events that occured during these sessions on a specific host. In order to make the table more readable we will shorten the CommanLine and ParentCommandLine fields to between 1 and 74 characters. The query below is crafted specifically for the host venus.

```go
index=botsv2
((Logon_ID=0x171491a OR LogonId=0x171491a) host=venus)
| eval shortCL=substr(CommandLine,1,74)
| eval shortPCL=substr(ParentCommandLine,1,74)
| table _time EventCode TaskCategory Account_Name Security_ID Process_Command_Line shortCL shortPCL
| sort + _time
```

As seen below we can see the processes that were run during the session. Several processes are clearly suspicious. Notably, is the ‚Äúwmiprvse.exe -secured -Embedding‚Äù command, that was identified in table 1 of the threat intel report.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/15bc5144-a76f-4c10-8849-c99b08c9eb32/955c37f1-8bf4-4c70-b6c5-4dbe3928b95f/Untitled.png)

We can run the same query, just replacing the host ‚Äúvenus‚Äù with the host ‚Äúwrk-klagerf‚Äù and the Logon_ID and LogonID to those associated with wrk-klagerf discovered earlier.

```go
index=botsv2
((Logon_ID=0xf9b47f OR LogonId=0xf9b47f) host=wrk-klagerf)
| eval shortCL=substr(CommandLine,1,74)
| eval shortPCL=substr(ParentCommandLine,1,74)
| table _time EventCode TaskCategory Account_Name Security_ID Process_Command_Line shortCL shortPCL
| sort + _time
```

On the wrk-klagerf host we see similar results, including the ‚Äúwmiprvse.exe -secured -Embedding‚Äù command.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/15bc5144-a76f-4c10-8849-c99b08c9eb32/ae4cdb83-fd0e-423d-8bfd-5b265f9aad63/Untitled.png)

We can pivot on the ‚Äúwmiprvse.exe -secured -Embedding‚Äù command to see if any other hosts were impacted. 

```go
index=botsv2
sourcetype="xmlwineventlog:microsoft-windows-sysmon/operational" ParentCommandLine="C:\\Windows\\system32\\wbem\\wmiprvse.exe -secured -Embedding"
| table _time user host ProcessId ParentProcessId CommandLine ParentCommandLine
```

As seen below, we see that the host wrk-btun was also impacted. That is the host belonging to Billy Tun, the user that interacted with the phishing email. The command line is a little different, but decoding the base64 we see it is similar. 

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/15bc5144-a76f-4c10-8849-c99b08c9eb32/9fa3a36e-942f-4bf6-87f3-fe31b70db0ac/Untitled.png)

Using Cyber Chef as seen below, the decoded base64 PowerShell is a partially obfuscated script.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/15bc5144-a76f-4c10-8849-c99b08c9eb32/225aeded-b3c8-4593-bf57-16eb95845772/Untitled.png)

This PowerShell script is designed to perform several actions, which appear to be part of a malicious operation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what it does:

1. **Disable AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface):**
    - The script disables AMSI by setting the `amsiInitFailed` field to `true`. This is a common technique used to bypass antivirus and antimalware protections in PowerShell.
2. **Set ServicePointManager Properties:**
    - It disables the `Expect100Continue` property to streamline HTTP requests.
    - It sets a user agent string to mimic a legitimate browser.
3. **Ignore SSL Certificate Validation:**
    - The script disables SSL certificate validation by setting the `ServerCertificateValidationCallback` to always return `true`. This allows it to connect to HTTPS sites without checking for valid certificates, often used to connect to malicious servers.
4. **Configure WebClient:**
    - It creates a new WebClient object for making HTTP requests.
    - It sets up the proxy to use the default network credentials, which means it will use the current user's credentials for network requests.
5. **Prepare Data for Encryption/Decryption:**
    - The script defines an ASCII byte array from a given string (`'389288edd78e8ea2f54946d3209b16b8'`).
    - It defines a decryption routine using an RC4-like algorithm, implemented in a PowerShell script block.
6. **Add Headers and Download Data:**
    - It adds a `Cookie` header with a specific value.
    - It specifies a target server (`https://45.77.65.211:443`) and a path (`/login/process.php`).
7. **Download and Decrypt Data:**
    - It downloads data from the specified URL.
    - It splits the downloaded data into an initialization vector (IV) and the actual data.
    - It then decrypts the data using the previously defined decryption routine.
8. **Execute Decrypted Data:**
    - Finally, it executes the decrypted data using the `Invoke-Expression` (`IEX`) cmdlet, which runs the decrypted script.

In summary, this PowerShell script is disabling security features, setting up a WebClient to communicate with a remote server, downloading an encrypted payload, decrypting it, and then executing the decrypted code. This is typical behavior for malware or a command-and-control script used in cyber attacks to execute arbitrary code on a compromised machine. The hard-coded IP address and specific paths strongly suggest it's designed for targeted attacks.

Based on additional research we can determine that the script appears to have characteristics associated with PowerShell Empire, which is a post-exploitation framework used by attackers for command and control, persistence, and lateral movement within a network.

For more information on PowerShell Empire see the links below:

Of note, in the deobfuscated PowerShell script we identified the IP address of the C2 server. Using IPinfo we discovered the hostname and the location the IP address is registered from.

# Conclusion

We have confirmed the hypothesis that WMI was used for lateral movement and discovered two additional hosts that have been compromised from the initial host belonging to Billy Tun.  PowerShell was used to faciliate the lateral movement. The malicious processes were running encoded PowerShell. Although the original infected host (wrk-btun) was impacted by encoded PowerShell, a different launcher was used, but the commands were the same. Lastly, the attacker appears to have used PowerShell Empire.

The diagram below shows what we discovered today.
