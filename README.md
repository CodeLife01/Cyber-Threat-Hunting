# üõ°Ô∏è Cyber Threat Hunting with Splunk

Welcome to the **Cyber Threat Hunting** repository ‚Äî a practical, hands-on learning series focused on identifying, investigating, and understanding adversary behavior using **Splunk** and the **Boss of the SOC v2 (BOTSv2)** dataset.

This project is ideal for cybersecurity analysts, blue teamers, and SOC professionals who want to level up their detection and hunting skills using real-world tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
